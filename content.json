    {
      "question": "Why do I owe penalties and interest on my tax bill, or get additional bills in the mail after I file?",
      "answer": "Taxes are due when income is RECEIVED!! This is why taxes are always taken out of your paycheck on a regular basis. If you do not have taxes taken out…. Such as from self-employment or investments, then you must make quarterly estimated payments throughout the year. If you do NOT make proper estimated payments, the IRS and state tax agencies have the full legal right to access penalties for not doing so. Interest accrues when payments are not made by the due date (not including extensions). This includes payment dates for estimated quarterly payments as well."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I avoid penalties and interest on my income taxes?",
      "answer": "Very simply…. pay all tax payments (including estimates) on time by the due date. Your total withholding or estimated tax must be either 100% of the prior years tax bill or 90% of your current tax bill. *For example, if your total federal tax liability on your 2023 return was $5,000, and your total tax liability in 2024 is $6,000, your 2024 withholding (or estimates paid) to avoid penalty must be $5,000. If your 2024 total tax liability is $4,500, then your minimum withholding would be $4,050. Anytime you owe more than $1,000 when you file, you can be subject to penalties unless these criteria are met."
    },
    {
      "question": "I’m self-employed, what can I deduct?",
      "answer": "Are you spending the money solely because you are self-employed? This is a start. For more detail, please see our Forms Library for a robust list of possible deductions and the explanations of each. These will vary based upon your business type. *Personal food is NEVER a deduction. A business meal is one shared by two or more people for the purpose of conducting business and is only 50% deductible. Meals or snacks provided to employees or staff can be 100% deductible if provided as a benefit to those individuals while they are working. (Coffee/Water Service, staff lunch during a meeting, etc.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I start an LLC or other entity?",
      "answer": "Do NOT make this decision based on social media or internet research. PLEASE seek professional advice. There are major pros and cons on entity selection and choosing the wrong one in the beginning can have dire consequences. We can provide personal guidance on this subject for those with questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is my filing status? (Single, Head of Household, Married Separate, Married Joint, or Surviving Spouse)",
      "answer": "Single: Unmarried on the last day of the tax year. (December 31st). If you are legally married, but legally separated (In divorce proceedings) for at least the last six months of the year, you can be considered unmarried for tax purposes and file as single. Head of Household: Not married, but have a dependent child or dependent parent you care for and provide more than 50% support. ... [Full provided text]"

    {
      "question": "Does 'profit first' accounting work?",
      "answer": "ABSOLUTELY NOT!! This is a scam and the easiest way to get yourself into debt and file for bankruptcy!! No one (including those who preach it) practices this in real life and succeed. ... [Full provided text]"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will having a rental property save me on taxes?",
      "answer": "Maybe…there are many factors that come into rental properties. There are absolutely NO guarantees of tax savings through losses. Please advise… this is a complicated subject that needs individual attention. ... [Full provided text]"
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of records do I need to keep for my business?",
      "answer": "Either use an accounting software like Quick Books Online or a spreadsheet. Keep accurate records and receipts. Most importantly, have a separate business account from a personal account. NO co-mingling personal with business!! We recommend either Wells Fargo or Bank of America (not user friendly for credit cards). Credit Unions tend to have more issues with business account."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when I own my personal residence with someone other than my spouse?",
      "answer": "This is actually a very good scenario under current tax law. You have a choice how to divide the Mortgage Interest and Property Taxes for itemized deductions. ... [Full provided text]"

    {
      "question": "Does my business owe the tax, or do I owe the tax?",
      "answer": "This is another questing we get a lot. The answer is, it depends on your business entity. ... [Full provided text]"
